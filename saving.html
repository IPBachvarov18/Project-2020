        Chemicals in some types of sunscreen can damage coral reefs and pollute turtle habitat.<br>
        Avoid any sunscreen with "oxybenzone" and look for brands labeled as "Reef Friendly" and <br>avoid sprays that can
            pollute the sand where turtles nest.</p>

            <h2>What Can You Do to Protect Sea Turtle Habitat?</h2>
            <p>Reduce marine debris that may entangle or be accidentally eaten by sea turtles.</p>
            <p>Participate in coastal clean-ups and reduce plastic use to keep our beaches and ocean clean.</p>
            <p>
                Carry reusable water bottles and shopping bags. Refrain from releasing balloons, they'll<br>
        likely end up in the ocean where sea turtles can mistake them for food and consume them.</p>
                <p>Do not disturb nesting turtles, nests, or hatchlings. Attend organized sea turtle<br>
                    watches that know how to safely observe nesting sea turtles.</p>
                <p>Turtles dig the dark! Sea turtles need dark beaches for nesting and for navigating their
                    way to the ocean.</p>
