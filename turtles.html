         <p><b>Sea turtles, sometimes called marine turtles, are reptiles of the order Testudines and of the suborder Cryptodira.<br>
           The seven existing species of sea turtles are:<br>
            The green sea turtle, Loggerhead sea turtle, Kemp's ridley sea turtle, olive ridley sea turtle, <br>hawksbill sea turtle, flatback sea turtle, and leatherback sea turtle.

           <h1>More info about them </h1>
          </div>
           <p><b>Importantly, for each of the seven types of sea turtles, females and males are the same size, i.e. there is no sexual dimorphism. <br>
          In general, sea turtles have a more fusiform body plan than their terrestrial or freshwater counterparts.<br>
           This tapering at both ends reduces volume and means that sea turtles can't, as can other turtles,<br> retract their head and limbs into their shells for protection.
           But the streamlined body <br>plan reduces friction and drag in the water and allows sea turtles to swim more easily and swiftly.<br>
          The leatherback sea turtle is the largest sea turtle, measuring 2–3 meters in length, and 1-1.5 m in width, weighing up to 700 kilograms.<br>
           Other sea turtle species are smaller, being mostly 60–120 cm long and proportionally narrower.</p></b>
